 Amarok - the audio player for KDE
===================================

There are many media players around these days, true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many
buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the playlist?
Amarok tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop
interface that really makes playlist handling easy.

 INFORMATION FOR PACKAGERS
===========================

It is possible to build Amarok to use MySQL as the database backend. Using
MySQL makes the Amarok collection faster.

In order to limit the dependencies the Amarok package demands we suggest
splitting Amarok into the following packages:

   1. Amarok + Phonon Engine
   2. iPod media device
   3. MTP media device

Amarok is modular and will be fully functional as long as one of 2 or 3 is
also installed. Hence we suggest Amarok + one backend.

If you make packages for Amarok please let us know and we'll link to you on the
homepage (as long as you don't object).

 CONTRIBUTING
==============

If you wish to contribute to Amarok, you should build it from SVN and subscribe
to the amarok AT kde.org mailing list. The IRC channel is also a place where
it's  nice  to  be, since you can talk to other developers much easier, and
get instant notification of commits to the SVN. For instant email notification
of commits, visit http://commitfilter.kde.org/ and http://amarok.be/fisheye
provides a slightly-less-instant overview.
