This is the last.fm service.

currently, we are using liblastfm as provided my max (max@last.fm) with the library copied internally. this is not ideal: as soon as we can, we want to depend on it externally. this awaits the official release of liblastfm by Last.Fm Ltd. 

there are a few local changes to get liblastfm to compile. these are detailed below:

OK, a lot of them were removing the "lib/" prefix from #include "lib/lastfm/DllExportMacro.h" or any other last.fm path

CoreProcess.h: add #include <unistd.h>

CoreLocale.h: fix lib/

DllExportMacro: well this file was pretty broken, as it doesn't actually export anything unless we're on windows. that doesn't allow liblastfm to be linked to anything for me, most likely due to our visibility settings, so i defined all the LIBLASTFM_EXPORTS to AMAROK_EXPORT and i worked.
